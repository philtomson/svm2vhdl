FPGA Implementation of a Support Vector Machine (SVM)

* What is a Support Vector Machine?
** SVMs are classifiers
** Machine Learning method
** Some similarity to Perceptrons

* The Formula

* Hardware Implementation issues:
** exp()
*** lookup table issues
**** resolution and range 
***** Range x: -12.25 to 0
***** 128 entries (18bits: 2 bits for integer part, 16 bits for fractional part)
** Other lookup tables:
*** alpha (242X16)
*** sv (support vectors) (485X16)
